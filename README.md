# Odin Computer Science

This repository contains projects related to the **Computer Science** section of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. Each project focuses on fundamental computer science concepts implemented in JavaScript.

## Projects

Here are the projects included in this repository:

1. **Fibonacci (Recursion)** - [`/fibonacci`](./fibonacci)  
   Implementation of Fibonacci sequence using recursive approaches.

2. **Merge Sort (Recursion)** - [`/mergesort`](./mergesort)  
   Recursive implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm.

3. **Linked List** - [`/linkedlist`](./linkedlist/)  
   Implementation of the Linked List.

4. **Hash Map** - [`/hashmap`](./hashmap/)  
   Implementation of the Hash Map and the Hash Set.

5. **Binary Search Tree** - [`/binarysearchtree`](./binarysearchtree/)  
   Implementation of the Binary Search Tree.

6. **Knights Travails** - [`/knightstravails`](./knightstravails/)  
   Solution to the Knights Travails problem.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A review of computer science fundamentals.
- A practical reference for algorithms and recursion concepts.
- A codebase for fellow Odin Project learners.
